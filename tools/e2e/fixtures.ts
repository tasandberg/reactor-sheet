/**
 * Foundry's `game.ready` boot (~40s on a 2-core CI runner under software WebGL)
 * dominates each spec. Booting per test would pay it 7×. Instead a worker-scoped
 * page joins once and every spec reuses that booted session — global-setup has
 * already enabled the module and seeded the actor, so the world is ready.
 *
 * Specs share this page, so they aren't isolated: afterEach closes the sheet and
 * any roll dialog to stop UI bleeding between them. They already share one worker
 * and one seeded actor, and their assertions are written relatively
 * (before/after counts, !wasEquipped), so order independence holds.
 *
 * A second user (player-vs-GM permission tests) would add its own context/page
 * fixture — not needed yet.
